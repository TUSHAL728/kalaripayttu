    <h1>History<h1><hr><p>The word Kalaripayattu is a combination of two Malayalam words—kalari (gym) and payattu (exercises practiced), which is roughly translated as “as exercises practiced in a gym.” The name “Kalaripayattu,” is also said to be derived from the name of Hindu deity Khaloorika Bhagavathy.[12] The word Kalari is also found in Sangam literature. The Akananuru and Purananuru describe the use of spears, swords, shields, bows and silambam in the Sangam era. The word kalari also appears in the Puram (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and Akam (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word kalari tatt denoted a martial feat, while kalari kozhai meant a coward in war. Each warrior in the Sangam era received regular military training[13] in target practice, horse and elephant riding. In that period and during later periods, the word used for military and military service was chevam. The warriors or soldiers in military service were called Chekavar. They specialized in one or more of the important weapons of the period including the spear (vel), sword (val), shield (kedaham), and bow and arrow (vil ambu). The combat techniques of the Sangam period were the earliest precursors to Kalaripayattu.[9] References to "Silappadikkaram" in Sangam literature date back to the 2nd century. This referred to the silambam staff which was in great demand with foreign visitors.[14][15]Other sources state that the word Kalari is derived from first three letters of Sri Vidhya Mantra.[5]
Elements from the yoga tradition as well as finger movements in the nata dances, were incorporated into the fighting arts.[16] A number of South Asian fighting styles remain closely connected to yoga, dance and performing arts. Some of the choreographed sparring in Kalaripayattu can be applied to dance[17] and Kathakali dancers who knew Kalaripayattu were believed to be markedly better than other performers. Until recently, only martial artists performed the Chhau dance. Some traditional Indian classical dance schools still incorporate martial arts as part of their exercise regimen.[18] Dancers in Kerala who had experience with Kalaripayattu were noted to be markedly better than the other performers. Some traditional Indian dance schools still incorporate Kalaripayattu as part of their training regimen.[citation needed]
According to legend, Parashurama is believed to have created the art shortly after bringing Kerala up from the ocean floor. Other theories postulate that certain tribal groups inhabiting ancient Kerala founded Kalaripayattu in order to defend themselves against threats from similar groups, such as the Thiyyar of the Malabar region of Kerala. During the medieval period, modern-day Kerala was divided into a number of principalities. Feuds and duels were common at the time, and Kalaripayattu was widely used for warfare and settling disputes. The accounts of that period are described in the Vadakkan Pattukal, a collection of ballads from Kerala. Kalaripayattu is said to have peaked during the days of the Vaddakan Pattukal, with a great deal of respect being attributed to experts in the martial art. Kalaripayattu began losing prominence beginning with the European invasions of Kerala.[1] Once European colonization began, the usage of firearms began to surpass the usage of traditional weaponry such as swords, and spears. The resurgence of public interest in Kalaripayattu began in the 1920s in Thalassery, as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout southern India[17] and continued through the 1970s surge of general worldwide interest in martial arts.[19]
Kalaripayattu includes strikes, kicks, grappling, preset forms, weaponry and healing methods.[17] Regional variants are classified according to geographical location in Kerala; these are the Northern style from the Malabar region in northern Kerala, and the Southern style from southern Kerala. Northern Kalaripayattu, or "Vadakkan Kalari" is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions, jumps and weapons training, while the southern "Thekkan Kalari" style specializes in hard, impact based techniques with priority on hand-to-hand combat and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts. Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor, as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor. Some of the methods used to enhance flexibility in Kalaripayattu are also utilized in Keralite dance forms such as Kathakali.[17]</p>
