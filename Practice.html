    <p>Traditions and methods of teaching of Kalaripayattu varied between different regions of Kerala. Kalaripayattu is taught in a specialized training ground known as a Kalari. Each kalari is built in accordance to Hindu architectural treatises such as the Vastu Shastras and Shilpa Shastras, along with various religious traditions and customs native to Kerala. The presiding deity of Kalaripayattu is said to be Shiva as well as Bhadrakali. Before every training session in the Kalari, salutations are provides to the presiding deities in the form of a mantra, or prayer.[citation needed]
Historically, all Keralites of the Hindu community, men and women alike, would undergo mandatory training in Kalaripayattu beginning at the age of 7 or 9 and lasting until the end of their education.[20] Warriors, soldiers and others who wanted to pursue a martial career would continue their training for the rest of their lives. Generally, two styles of Kalaripayattu are acknowledged among Kalari practitioners: the Northern Style and the Southern Style.[21] These two systems are quite similar, but their training methods begin to diverge to specialize in either weapons or hand-to-hand combat. The styles are variations that various masters have adapted and modified according to their understanding of the art. Development and mastery of Kalaripayattu comes from the tradition of constantly learning, adapting and improving the techniques by observing what techniques are practical and effective. There is a great amount of respect and observation of tradition which allows the preservation of the art. The knowledge and experience gained by the practitioners is improved upon by subsequent masters who utilize keen observation, research of various techniques and variations to update the knowledge. The adaptability of Kalaripayattu is largely due to Kalaripayattu being designed for use in warfare and combat. A Kalari practitioner might encounter new fighting techniques from an enemy combatant. The Kalari practitioner would need to learn how to anticipate, adapt to and neutralize these new techniques. This is especially seen in the Southern style of Kalaripayattu, which is believed to have been adapted and modified during wars with Tamil kingdoms to counter martial arts like Silambam, which was one of the main martial art forms practiced by Tamil soldiers at the time.[22] Kalaripayattu is ultimately taught not just as a martial art, but as a way of life that epitomizes respect, compassion and duty over all else.[23]</p>
